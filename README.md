# ix-lisbon-project-week-1
https://rebeccaerenbaum.github.io/

to make a poker game:
-ask for names
-assign five random cards to each name
-find max value for each player
-if two players have the same max, pop the max value from the list of cards and find the next max, compare them, and whichever has the higher value return that player

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.
